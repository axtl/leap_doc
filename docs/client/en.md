Bitmask
=======

**Bitmask** is the multiplatform desktop client for the services offered by
[the LEAP Platform](platform).  It is written in python using
[PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) and licensed under the GPL3. Currently we distribute pre-compiled bundles for Linux and OSX, with Windows bundles following soon.
